        <p > Life insurance compensates for the financial loss that occurs to a family due to the death<br/>
         of a person. Human life cannot be evaluated and the loss of a person cannot be<br/>
        compensated but the financial loss that occurs due to the loss of that person can be<br/>
        evaluated and compensated. Life insurance on the bread earners of the family is much<br/>
        important because, after the sudden demise of the person, the amount claimed in the<br/>
        life insurance policy helps them financially.</p>

        <p><em>Term insurance</em>: These are pure Vanilla life insurance policies that cover an individual.<br/>
        The premiums are comparatively low when compared to other products.</p>
        <p><em>Endowment policies:</em> These are types of savings policies. Sum insured in these policies are<br/>
        usually low and premiums are high for high coverage.</p>
        <p><em>ULIP</em>: These policies are linked to the market. Part amount of the premium paid by the <br/>
        policyholder is invested in the stock market. The value of the policy depends on the <br/>
        market value of the funds or stocks the insurance company has invested in. The sum<br/>
        insured in these policies is usually low.</p>

        coming years if a person dies today, all liabilities have to be covered along with the<br/>

        life insurance without using it as an investment tool.</p>
